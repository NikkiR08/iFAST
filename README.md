## Aim
To evaluate the impact of a new antibiotic susceptibility test on urinary tract infection (UTI) patient outcomes and costs in secondary care, for example improving prescription of effective antibiotics and financial benefits linked to de-escalation of costly therapy, early discharge from high dependency hospital wards to the community and reducing isolation time for patients with high-risk bacterial isolates. We will perform a cost-effectiveness, from the NHS perspective, to investigate whether this technology is deemed economically efficient in according with pre-defined thresholds of acceptability.
